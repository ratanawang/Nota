# Nota

Nota is an intelligent note-taking web app that allows its users to focus on learning. On the backend, it uses Python Flask to build the web app, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript were used for styling the web pages. It employs Google Cloud’s Natural Language API to detect which words are worth noting, Firebase to utilize user authentication, and Firestore to store the users’ data.
