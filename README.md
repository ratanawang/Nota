# Nota

Nota is an intelligent note-taking web app that allows its users to focus on learning. Currently, the web app takes copy-pasted text as input and outputs a list of the most important words or phrases. In the future, we plan to add support for image/audio input, account-based cloud saving and a more sophisticated note processing algorithm. Nota uses Python, Flask, various GCloud Services (Natural Language API, App Engine, etc.), Firebase Authentication, and Cloud Firestore.
